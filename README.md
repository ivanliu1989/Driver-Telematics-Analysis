Driver Telematics Analysis
==========================

For automobile insurers, telematics represents a growing and valuable way to quantify driver risk. Instead of pricing decisions on vehicle and driver characteristics, telematics gives the opportunity to measure the quantity and quality of a driver's behavior. This can lead to savings for safe or infrequent drivers, and transition the burden to policies that represent increased liability.

AXA has provided a dataset of over 50,000 anonymized driver trips. The intent of this competition is to develop an algorithmic signature of driving type. Does a driver drive long trips? Short trips? Highway trips? Back roads? Do they accelerate hard from stops? Do they take turns at high speed? The answers to these questions combine to form an aggregate profile that potentially makes each driver unique.

For this competition, Kaggle participants must come up with a "telematic fingerprint" capable of distinguishing when a trip was driven by a given driver. The features of this driver fingerprint could help assess risk and form a crucial piece of a larger telematics puzzle.
